# CanvasAPIScripts

This is a repository of scripts that I created to get information from Canvas using the Canvas API. I make no promises that any of this will work.

### last_nonzero_score.py
A script to estimate the last date of participation in a course using the date of the last assignment with a nonzero score as a proxy.
